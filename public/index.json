I appended this line to the blog post directly from the terminal again!, deploiying to neocities is as simple as git push! Being able to blog to neocities directly from my terminal is a cool novelty for sure, but its actually a by-product of the way I have set up my hugo site and wired it into neocities!\nUsing the neocities API key generator, I was able to create a git repo for my website and push its contents to git hub, then using the API key inside github I was able to set up an auto deployment action for neocities! So now whenever I make any changes or add new content into my blog and push it to github, it automatically deploys the content to neocities!\nOne of the really cool things about the setup is that my sites entire project uses approx 600mb of space, but the actual rendered files in the public folder are the only ones that get deployed to github, which means I can have a pretty extensive theme setup and resources available in the repo, but when i push the site to neocities only a few mb of space is required to host the output!\n","date":"24 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/24-07-25/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Blog from the terminal!","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"24 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"24 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"s i t e s b y d o u g","summary":"","title":"s i t e s b y d o u g","type":"page"},{"content":" So I\u0026rsquo;ve just wrapped up day 2 of my first gig as a freeelance Web Developer, it\u0026rsquo;s been great! I\u0026rsquo;m not sure id class much of the work ive done so far as \u0026ldquo;Web Dev\u0026rdquo;, but its been a great opportunity to work on some real live in production commercial websites.\nI suppose the purpose is this blog is to talk about these tasks and record my day to day activity as a newbie in tthe field, and hopefully record and imporove any workflow optimizations i might encounter!\nMuch of my first day consisted of creating 10 location based pages for a car dealership, I was given a google doc of the relevant copy and let loose inside the clients WP backend. The google doc was handy but I knew i was in for a lot of copy pasting with all the site content and metadata to get through. I wanted a more streamlined way to retrieve the content to and from my clipboard so I had Chat GPT turn the google doc into a spreadhseet, using a combination of alt+tab and some clipboard short cuts I was able to turn the forecasted 3-6 hour task into 1.5 hours relaxed work!\nThe next task was creating 5 blog posts for the site, again I turned the content document for the posts into a table and quickly tabbed my way through populating the posts with the content. I rounded out my day by updating meta data (title, descript, focus keyword) across another clients website using the Yoast bulk editor tool. Unfortunately the Yoast bulk editor tool only allows you to edit title and description, so the focus keywords had to be added in manually to each page. I opened up all 36 pages editors as tabs in my browser and again used a combination of keyboard shortcuts to navigate between the table containing all the seo data and the input fields on each tab.\nToday has been similar, 15 location pages, 5 new blog posts etc, but this site was built on a different theme to the previous site so navigation was slightly different but ultimately the same.\nMy main take away from these two days is that Working opn wordpress sites really does hilight the fact its a CMS, I would say that the main part of maintaining a clients website is handling the content in an organised and efficiant fashion. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure google docs (with lots of formatting, ambiguous seperation of content etc) is the best format to use when sharing content as a resource. I found I had a much more fluid experience using sheets and even raw text when handling the copy content.\nThe WFH experience has been great so far. I am task oriented and able to self schedule so being able to work in a comfortable environment with all my comforts and my dog is honestly a blessing.\n","date":"23 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/23-07-25/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Freelance Web Dev, Day One.","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
